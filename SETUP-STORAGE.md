# Storage Setup Guide

## Quick Fix Applied ✅

**Image uploads now work immediately!** I've applied a temporary fix that converts images to base64 and stores them in the database. This works for development but isn't ideal for production.

## For Production: Set Up Proper Storage Buckets

### Step 1: Run the Storage Setup Script

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Copy and paste the contents of `setup-storage-buckets.sql`
5. Click **Run**

### Step 2: Switch to Production Upload Code

After running the storage setup script:

1. Open `src/app/author/upload/page.tsx`
2. In the `uploadCoverImage` function, **comment out** the temporary base64 code
3. **Uncomment** the production storage code
4. Save the file

### What the Storage Setup Does

- Creates three storage buckets:
  - `podcast-covers` - For cover images
  - `podcast-audio` - For audio files
  - `podcast-scripts` - For script files

- Sets up proper security policies:
  - Users can only upload to their own folders
  - Public can view the files
  - Users can update/delete their own files

### Benefits of Proper Storage

✅ **Better Performance**: Images load faster from CDN  
✅ **Scalability**: No database bloat from large files  
✅ **Security**: Proper access controls  
✅ **Cost Effective**: Storage is cheaper than database space  

### Current Status

- **Image uploads**: ✅ Working (base64 temporary fix)
- **Podcast detail page**: ✅ Fixed (params.id issue resolved)
- **Storage buckets**: ⚠️ Need to run `setup-storage-buckets.sql`

### Files Created

- `setup-storage-buckets.sql` - Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
- `quick-image-upload-fix.tsx` - Reference for the temporary fix
- `SETUP-STORAGE.md` - This guide

You can now upload images immediately, and they'll be stored as base64 in the database until you set up the proper storage buckets!
